Description
===========

There are 2 states: statePing and statePong
When timer running then:
Maximum lifetime of statePing is 1000 ms - it will then automatically transition to statePong;
Maximum lifetime of statePong is 2000 ms - it will then automatically transition to statePing.

Keyboard-Input can cause transitions before the max-lifetime-timeouts:
'x': xchange state
'i': leave current state and go to statePing (pIng)
'o': leave current state and go to statePong (pOng)
't': toggle timer (on/off)
'q' or eof (Ctrl-d): exit



Two versions
============

a) qt_ping_pong
b) qt_ping_pong_event_templates

Version a) is better in terms of less generated code-size
